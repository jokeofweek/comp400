Angular Analyzer
================
This is my research project for COMP 400. It is a Chrome extension which allows you to inspect the behavior and dependencies of an application written using AngularJS. When installed, it will add a button to the toolbar which, when clicked, can produce a model of the application in a separate tab.

### How to install
To install the extension, go to chrome://extensions. Drag and drop the extension.crx file into the tab.

### Example model
Here is a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/GOeeRp7.png) of an example model. This model was generated for [http://betrend.pt/#/all/](http://betrend.pt/#/all/).

### How to use
When exploring the model, nodes can be expanded and collapsed. To obtain more details about a node, Ctrl-Click on the node. This will populate the box below the search field with the node's properties.
